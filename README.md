These files include exploratory analysis I undertook on Bike sales by considering age brackets, location, gender etc.
The Vrinda file contains similar analysis that uses pivot tables to gain deeper insights.
These were preceded by data cleaning efforts in both cases.
Cosmic file is my first real world application of SQL using BigQuery.(I unfortunately cannot make the data public as they contain confidential insurance, loan repayments, telephone, contacts etc.).
Faced with the challenge to find and match names from two large datasets - insurance register and repayments, such that names in the repayments sheet and their contacts can be matched with those in the Insurance sheet and a new sheet containing CLIENT_NAME, EXPIRING_DATE and CONTACTS created, the uploaded JOINS query was run.
